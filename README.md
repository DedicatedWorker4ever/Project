# Cinema-XXX


A README.md file with n-individual sections where EACH MEMBER in the group must explain where he mostly has participated. 
If you use "funny names" on GitHub the README- file must include a list that maps these names to "study name/ID's" so I can see who has committed what.
Your README file should also include a link to your hosted server and (if any) the swagger documentation of your endpoints.

Section 4 - Chiara Visca (GitHub username: Chia - chia030)

I mostly participated in: 
- setting up the repository with a base layer that everyone could start from,
- backlog points #1, #2 and #5 from the first sprint,
- backlog point #4 and #7 from the second sprint.

These were my main focal points but none of my work was completed by myself alone! 
Our multiple daily meetings made it so anything we did was achieved through shared effort.
