# Cinema-XXX


A REAME.md file with n-individual sections where EACH MEMBER in the group must explain where he mostly has participated. 
If you use "funny names" on GitHub the README- file must include a list that maps these names to "study name/ID's" so I can see who has committed what.
Your README file should also include a link to your hosted server and (if any) the swagger documentation of your endpoints.
